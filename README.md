This course aims to get an overview of Project Management Cloud, by having an introduction to the key processes involved in managing projects. Topics include:

- Manage Financial Projects
- Managing Project Cost
- Managing Project Contracts, Invoices and Revenue
- Manage Projects for Work Planning
- Manage project peformance by using predefined dashboards and infolets
 
The assessment comprises 20 questions, with multiple choices and true/false selections. Aim to score 80% or higher to pass. 

However, I have 4 questions that I am unsure of the answers (refer to PDF file above). I hope the community can help to find the correct answers, and let me know by creating a Pull Request. Cheers!
